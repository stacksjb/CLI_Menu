# CLI_Menu
A simple Rust App to run config options from CLI

This is a simple app I used ChatGPT to write to help learn Rust and also to give me a framework for my daily CLI workflow.


*Most of the credit goes to ChatGPT which wrote most of the code. Thanks to @Scott Pack for his talk at BSides 2023 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_pkz4kDfq0) which helped set the stage
